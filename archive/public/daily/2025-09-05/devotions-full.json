[{"exegesis":"```json\n{\n  \"exegesis\": \"The first reading, likely from Sirach or a wisdom book, reflects the Jewish tradition’s emphasis on humility as a prerequisite for wisdom and divine favor. In the historical context, Israelite society valued humility as a safeguard against arrogance that leads to social discord and spiritual downfall. The text encourages recognizing one’s place before God and others, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament.\\n\\nThe psalm, a prayer of trust, situates the believer in the context of God’s covenant faithfulness. It recalls God’s justice as a refuge for the humble and oppressed, a common motif in Israel’s experience of exile and restoration. The psalmist’s confidence in God’s mercy invites the faithful to rely not on their own strength but on God’s saving power.\\n\\nIn the Gospel of Luke (14:1, 7-14), Jesus addresses a Pharisee’s banquet, a setting where social status and honor were keenly observed. Jesus’ parable about taking the lowest seat subverts the cultural norms of honor and prestige, teaching that true exaltation comes from God’s grace, not human acclaim. His instruction to invite the poor and marginalized reflects the kingdom’s upside-down values, where the last are first and the humble are exalted. This teaching challenges the Pharisees’ pride and exclusivity, calling all to a radical hospitality rooted in humility.\\n\\nSt. Teresa of Calcutta’s life (1910-1997) embodies these scriptural themes. Her founding of the Missionaries of Charity and her dedication to the poorest reflect the Gospel’s call to serve “the least of these.” Her humility was not passive but active, a lived theology of love and self-emptying that earned her global recognition and sainthood.\"\n}\n```\n"}]
