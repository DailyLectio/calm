    "firstReading": "Colossians 1:15-20 - Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. In him all things in heaven and on earth were created, visible and invisible, including thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the Body, the Church, the beginning, and the firstborn from the dead, so that in all things he might be preeminent. All the fullness was pleased to dwell in him, and through him to reconcile all things by making peace through his blood on the cross.",
    "psalmSummary": "Psalm 100:1B-5 - A joyful call to worship the Lord with gladness and joyful song, recognizing that the Lord is God who made us and we belong to him. The psalm invites all lands to serve the Lord with gladness and come before him with joyful song.",
    "gospelSummary": "Luke 5:33-39 - Jesus addresses questions about fasting and uses parables about new wine and old wineskins to teach about the newness of his ministry. He emphasizes that the new covenant he brings cannot be contained by old forms, highlighting the transformative nature of his message.",
    "dailyPrayer": "Lord Jesus, You who humbled Yourself to serve and save, teach us to embrace humility in our hearts and actions. Help us to seek not honor for ourselves but to serve others with love and generosity, especially those in need. May the example of St. Teresa inspire us to live out the Gospel with courage and compassion. Strengthen our faith and guide us in humble service.",
    "saintReflection": "St. Teresa of Calcutta exemplifies profound humility and dedication to the poorest of the poor. Her life and missionary work, including founding the Missionaries of Charity, embody the Gospel’s call to serve without seeking reward. Her radical charity and self-emptying love model the Gospel’s demand to serve the least and humblest.",
    "theologicalSynthesis": "The readings and reflections for this day emphasize humility as central to Christian life. Paul’s letter to the Colossians presents Christ as supreme and the source of all creation and reconciliation, calling believers to recognize divine power over human wisdom. The psalm invites joyful service to God, while the Gospel challenges social pride and introduces the new covenant of grace through Jesus’ ministry. St. Teresa’s life illustrates living out this humility through selfless service, showing that true exaltation comes from humbling oneself before God and others."
