[{"exegesis":"```json\n{\n  \"exegesis\": \"The Gospel passage from Luke 14:11 is situated within Jesus’ teaching on humility and the proper use of honor at banquets, a cultural setting where social status was publicly displayed. Jesus challenges the prevailing social norms by instructing His listeners to choose the lowest place rather than the highest, thereby avoiding the embarrassment of being asked to move down. This teaching subverts worldly values of status and power, emphasizing that God’s kingdom operates on a different principle: those who humble themselves will be exalted by God.\\n\\nHistorically, this teaching would have resonated deeply in a society structured by rigid social hierarchies. Jesus’ call to humility was radical, inviting all to a reversal of values. This theme is consistent with Philippians 2:6-11, where Paul describes Christ’s kenosis—His self-emptying and obedience even unto death on the cross. Jesus’ humility is not passive but active obedience, demonstrating the path to true glory.\\n\\nThe first reading and psalm (though not detailed here) typically complement this message by recalling God’s faithfulness and the call to trust and humility before Him. The saint of the day, through their life and witness, embodies these virtues, providing a concrete example of living out the Gospel.\"\n}\n```\n"}]
