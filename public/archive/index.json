Daniel's vision of 'one like a son of man' receiving eternal dominion prefigures Christ's divine sonship, while Peter's eyewitness testimony establishes the Transfiguration as both historical reality and eschatological preview. The transformation reveals Jesus as the bridge between temporal and eternal, human and divine, fulfilling the Law (Moses) and Prophets (Elijah) while transcending both. This manifestation of glory strengthens the disciples for the coming passion, demonstrating that suffering and glory are inextricably united in God's redemptive plan.",
