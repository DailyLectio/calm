[{"exegesis":"```json\n{\n  \"exegesis\": \"The Gospel passage from Luke 14:11, “Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted,” is situated within Jesus’ teaching on humility at a banquet. In the historical context of first-century Jewish society, honor and status were highly valued, often demonstrated by seating arrangements at feasts. Jesus subverts these social norms by instructing His listeners to take the lowest place, thereby practicing humility rather than seeking human praise. This teaching aligns with the broader Johannine and Pauline theology of kenosis, or self-emptying, where Christ, though divine, humbles Himself to serve humanity (Philippians 2:6-11). The first reading’s emphasis on obedience to God’s law and the psalm’s praise of God’s justice frame this humility within the covenant relationship, where God’s exaltation is the reward for faithful service. Saint Rosalia’s life of solitude and penitence mirrors this Gospel call, showing that true exaltation comes through self-denial and prayerful dependence on God, rather than worldly recognition.\"\n}\n```\n"}]
