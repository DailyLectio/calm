    "exegesis": "The readings for today provide a profound insight into the nature of leadership and greatness in the Christian context. In the first reading, the emphasis on humility sets the stage for understanding Jesus' radical redefinition of greatness in the Gospel. Jesus, in Mark 10:43, states, 'Whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant.' This statement flips societal norms, especially in a culture that often equates power with authority and dominance. Jesus embodies this teaching through his actions and ultimate sacrifice on the cross. The psalm reinforces the theme of trust in God, suggesting that true security and strength come not from human power but from divine assistance. As we reflect on these themes, we are called to examine our own lives: Are we seeking to elevate ourselves, or are we genuinely serving those around us? In a world that often prioritizes individual achievement, the challenge remains to embrace a servant's heart, recognizing that in serving others, we find our true purpose and identity in Christ. This message is especially relevant today as we navigate complex social dynamics where self-interest often prevails over communal well-being.",
