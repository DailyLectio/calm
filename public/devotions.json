    "quote": "Many are invited, but few are chosen.",
    "quoteCitation": "Mt 22:14",
    "firstReading": "Jephthah’s vow, born out of desperation, signals how far Israel had wandered from God. Seeking victory at any price, Jephthah promises a human sacrifice—a reminder that even religious zeal can be tragically misdirected when not guided by wisdom and humility. In Israel’s crisis, the need for discernment is acute.",
    "psalmSummary": "Psalm 40 is a psalm of deliverance, sung by one who has experienced rescue from the pit. The psalmist is overwhelmed by God’s wondrous deeds and responds with willing obedience, offering his life as a living sacrifice.",
    "gospelSummary": "Jesus’s parable of the wedding feast dramatizes the perils of presumption and apathy. Many are invited, but only those properly prepared enter the celebration. The lesson is clear: divine invitation demands a response—conversion of heart and mind, not mere attendance.",
    "saintReflection": "On this memorial, Saint Pius X stands as a model of pastoral renewal. His reforms in liturgy and catechesis, and his dedication to the Eucharist, bore fruit in the life of the Church. Pius X's life reminds us that authentic response to God’s call must be expressed in both devotion and action.",
    "dailyPrayer": "O God, attune us to your invitation each day. Guard us from complacency, and give us courage to live in response to your mercy. Teach us to act with wisdom and boldness, as Saint Pius X did, for the good of your Church.",
    "theologicalSynthesis": "Invitation demands preparation, and favor requires response—today’s readings unite in calling disciples to vigilant readiness for the kingdom. The history of the Church’s saints models what it means to accept grace with responsibility.",
    "exegesis": "Jephthah’s narrative is marked by skill and heartbreak; his fatal vow exposes both the peril of desperate faith and the tragic potential of zeal unmoored from discernment. The reading is both warning and invitation to a deeper, more reasoned reliance on God.\\nPsalm 40’s song is one of gratitude that refuses to settle into passivity. God delivers, so the response is not mere relief but joyful and sacrificial obedience.\\nIn the Gospel, Jesus’s parable works on multiple levels: the original guests’ refusal is a mirror of Israel’s history, while the newcomer’s lack of wedding garment is a warning against “cheap grace”—acceptance without conversion.\\nPius X did not confine his response to piety but acted decisively to grow in holiness and help others do the same. Saints are living proof that the banquet of the kingdom is meant to transform every part of life.",
