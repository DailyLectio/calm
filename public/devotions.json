    "quote": "Go, sell what you have and give to the poor.",
    "quoteCitation": "Mt 19:21",
    "firstReading": "After the death of Joshua, a new generation forgets the Lord and turns to idolatry. The Book of Judges recounts a tragic pattern: Israel’s failure to remember leads to spiritual decline, oppression, and finally repentance after suffering. Each time, God raises a judge to deliver and restore the people—but as comfort returns, so does forgetfulness. The reading is a sober warning against complacency and a call to remember the works of the Lord.",
    "psalmSummary": "Psalm 106 recounts the people’s infidelity but also God’s mercy. It weaves confession and thanksgiving together, showing that even in repeated rebellion, the Lord’s compassion endures. The psalmist invites us not to lose heart over past failures—to return and be healed.",
    "gospelSummary": "In his encounter with the rich young man, Jesus issues a radical challenge: true discipleship is not just about obeying commandments but about letting go of attachments that hinder love. When the young man hesitates, his sadness reveals the cost of invitation. Jesus laments how hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom—and how all things are possible with God.",
    "saintReflection": "Saint Helena, commemorated today, searched for the True Cross and showed extraordinary generosity to the poor and the Church. Her faith and material detachment exemplify the gospel’s hard call. Helena’s quest and discoveries inspire Christians to value Christ above all and make tangible sacrifices in love.",
    "dailyPrayer": "Lord, free our hearts from every idol, every comfort that keeps us distant. Grant us generosity and detachment. Remind us daily to seek you above all, and give with a cheerful and liberated spirit.",
    "theologicalSynthesis": "Patterns of forgetting, repentance, and restoration form the heart of today’s readings. God’s invitation beckons us not to settle for half-hearted faith, but to let the radical generosity of Christ redefine our lives and priorities.",
    "exegesis": "Judges opens with a sobering historical motif: spiritual amnesia begets moral chaos, but God’s patience is greater still. The first reading shows how cultural assimilation and forgetfulness leave Israel vulnerable; only frankly naming failures allows genuine renewal.\nPsalm 106 is a litany of both lament and hope. Rather than paper over rebellion, the psalmist recounts struggles before celebrating deliverance. The refrain is mercy—God’s unshakable resolve to save, time and again.\nMatthew’s vignette of the rich young man is both pastoral and bracing. Jesus responds to an earnest question about “eternal life” not by reciting rules, but by pointing to the interior freedom and courage necessary for love. The “one thing you lack” is not merely generosity, but willingness to be changed. The young man’s sadness becomes a mirror for our own reluctance.\nSaint Helena’s search for the cross was grounded in surrender of both prestige and possessions. Her willingness to respond to God’s call and to sacrificial love changed history. The true cross is always discovered by those who are willing to risk all to follow Jesus more closely.",
