    "theologicalSynthesis": "Word, sacrament and shepherd converge: divine providence answers physical and spiritual famine, challenging contemporary cultures of scarcity to adopt Vianney’s radical availability.",
    "exegesis": "Israel’s nostalgic craving in the desert unmasks every age’s temptation to prefer predictable slavery over trusting freedom. The manna narrative echoes in the grassy hillside of Galilee where Christ, the new Moses, refuses to dismiss the crowd. Instead, He seats them in Eucharistic order, blesses humble provisions and creates a community of sharing that foreshadows the Church. Saint John Vianney mirrors that same logic: he let grace multiply through him for decades, turning Ars from indifference to fervor. Modern disciples, overwhelmed by the world’s needs, hear Moses’ lament yet receive Christ’s imperative, “Give them some food yourselves.” The miracle teaches that ministry begins with compassion, proceeds by obedience and concludes in superabundance—a pattern meant for parishes, families and nations today.",
