Being children of God marks a moral and ontological transformation: believers practice justice and love toward brothers and sisters. Christ’s appearing was to destroy sin; he is the source of our purification. Those who remain in him will resemble him, for he is righteous, and we will share his destiny as children of God.","secondReading":"","psalmSummary":"Psalm 98 summons all creation to sing a new song for the Lord’s marvelous deeds and victory. The psalm celebrates God’s revealed salvation, calling the sea, rivers, and hills to join in joyful praise. God’s justice and saving acts inspire music and rejoicing—trumpet, strings, and song—because the Lord has made known his saving power and established his reign over the nations.","gospelSummary":"John the Baptist identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the world’s sin, framing Jesus’ mission in sacrificial and salvific terms. He sees the Spirit descend like a dove upon Jesus and remains a witness to that sign. John clarifies that he baptizes with water but foretells one who will baptize with Spirit. His testimony both recognizes Jesus’ unique status as God’s Son and invites others to believe through eyewitness revelation. The passage emphasizes divine approval—visible in the Spirit’s descent—and connects Jesus’ identity with fulfillment of God’s redemptive purpose: to remove sin and inaugurate a new covenantal life for those who believe.","saintReflection":"Holy Name of Jesus (Optional Memorial): The Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus honors the name given to the Son of God at his circumcision, eight days after his birth.[144][150] The name “Jesus,” meaning “God saves,” expresses his mission to redeem humanity from sin and death.[147] Promoted especially by Franciscans and formally approved as a feast in the 16th century, this celebration invites the faithful to reverence and invoke the Name with faith, in accord with Saint Paul’s teaching that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend.[144][171]","dailyPrayer":"Lord Jesus, Lamb of God and Holy Name above all names, we praise and invoke you. By your coming you took away sin and opened a way for us to be born of God. Grant that hearing John’s witness and seeing the Spirit rest upon you, we may believe and live as your children—rejecting habitual sin, practicing justice, and loving our brothers and sisters. May your Name be our refuge and strength in trial; teach us to call upon it with reverence, trust, and courage. Sanctify our words so that we honor your Name in speech and action. Send your Spirit to baptize and transform us, that we might reflect your righteousness and participate in your life. Through the power of your Name, reconcile and heal our world, that all may sing a new song to the Lord for his marvelous deeds. Give us strength to bear witness to you in word and deed, so others may find salvation. Amen.","theologicalSynthesis":"Today's readings unite confession, witness, and praise around the person and name of Jesus. 1 John stresses that those 'born of God' live righteously and cannot remain in habitual sin; Christ came to destroy sin and make us like him. Psalm 98 bursts into song for the Lord’s saving deeds, calling all creation to joyful response. John the Baptist’s testimony identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God and records the Spirit descending as God’s sign of approval. Together they form a theological arc: God acts decisively in Christ to remove sin, the Spirit attests and empowers, and the faithful respond in repentance, ethical transformation, and praise. The Feast of the Holy Name directs attention to the power vested in Jesus’ name—invoked for salvation, healing, and authority. Practically, believers are called to confess his name, embody his righteousness, and join creation’s song of thanksgiving. This name summons trust and mission: Christians speak, serve, and suffer under its lordship, confident of final vindication.","exegesis":"Context: The first reading (1 John 2:29–3:6) belongs to a letter that addresses community identity and moral integrity. John writes to reassure believers that being 'born of God' is more than theological assertion: it issues in ethical life. In the early Christian context, disputes about sin, Christ’s nature, and community boundaries made such assurances necessary. John reminds his readers that Christ’s coming has pragmatic consequences: victory over sin and a transformed people. Placing this alongside John 1:29–34 and Psalm 98 highlights an early Christian imagination in which Christ’s identity, Spirit-bearing, and communal response form a single spiritual and moral economy.\n\nPsalm: Psalm 98 provides the liturgical mood for today. Its call to sing a new song for marvelous deeds complements the Johannine insistence on transformation. The psalm makes salvation communal and cosmic: not only Israel but sea, rivers, and hills join the praise. Musically rich images—trumpet, strings, and song—underscore worship as a communal and aesthetic response to divine acts. When read with the Gospel’s announcement of the Lamb and John’s witness, the psalm frames believers’ response: praise that springs from an encounter with God’s saving deed and from recognition of God’s just rule over the nations.\n\nGospel: John 1:29–34 is a concentrated baptismal and christological claim. John the Baptist’s declaration 'Behold the Lamb of God' names the vocation of Jesus in sacrificial terms and anticipates the paschal dimension of his mission. The sign of the Spirit descending like a dove functions as divine authentication: the Father’s approval and the presence of the Spirit validate Jesus’ identity and ministry. John’s role as witness is paramount; his testimony is offered not as mere speculation but as eyewitness report tied to a sign. The passage juxtaposes water baptism with the greater baptism in Spirit, pointing to an inaugurated eschatology in which Spirit and Son work together to overcome sin.\n\nSaints: The Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus directs attention to the power and mission encoded in a name. In Christian tradition the naming at circumcision (on the eighth day) links identity, covenant, and history. The name 'Jesus'—'God saves'—summarizes the salvific content of the Gospel and invites invocation. Historically promoted by Franciscan devotion and later fixed in the calendar, the feast encourages reverence for the person revealed by John the Baptist and celebrated by the psalm’s joyful song. The Name becomes a locus for prayer, devotion, and theologically grounded trust in God’s saving action.\n\nScriptural connections: The readings form interlocking motifs: recognition (John’s witness), transformation (1 John’s ethical demand), and praise (Psalm 98). Each text highlights an aspect of salvation: identification of the Savior, the Spirit’s attestation, and the believer’s response. The Lamb imagery establishes a sacrificial paradigm that explains why God’s people are now called to holiness—because Christ’s action remakes moral possibilities. The Spirit motif links baptism and ongoing sanctification. Thus the biblical theology here is Trinitarian and soteriological: Father attests, Son accomplishes, Spirit transforms, and creation sings.\n\nPastoral application: For communities today the combined message is practical. Hearing John’s witness should lead to recognition and commitment rather than mere assent. 1 John’s insistence on ethical fruit challenges nominal Christianity: being 'born of God' must show itself in loving action and a refusal to live in habitual sin. The psalm exhorts liturgical and communal rejoicing—worship that informs mission. Devotion to the Holy Name cultivates reliance on Jesus’ authority in prayer and in the struggles of daily life. Pastors can use these readings to catechize about baptismal identity, to encourage confession and conversion, and to foster doxological communities that witness to God’s marvelous deeds in word and deed.","tags":["holy-name-of-jesus","lamb-of-god","holy-name","1-john","john-1","psalm-98","baptism","spirit","salvation","feast"],"usccbLink":"https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/010326.cfm","cycle":"Year B","weekdayCycle":"Cycle II","feast":"Optional Memorial","firstReadingRef":"1 John 2:29–3:6","secondReadingRef":"","psalmRef":"Psalm 98:1, 3cd-4, 5-6","gospelRef":"John 1:29-34","lectionaryKey":"2026-01-03:1 John 2:29–3:6||Psalm 98:1, 3cd-4, 5-6|John 1:29-34"}]
