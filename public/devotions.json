[{"date":"2026-02-03","quote":"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace","quoteCitation":"Mark 5:34 (USCCB)","firstReading":"The passage recounts the violent death of Absalom during his flight after rebellion. Absalom becomes entangled by his hair in an oak tree; Joab or one of his men drives javelins into the young man, finishing the act despite Absalom still being alive. Messengers are sent with the report to King David. David learns of his son’s death and is overcome with grief, tearing his garments and mourning loudly, lamenting the loss even as the political consequence of the rebellion unfolds.","secondReading":"","psalmSummary":"Psalm 86 is a heartfelt plea for mercy and attentive help. The psalmist calls to the Lord for rescue, asking that God listen, preserve life, and show steadfast love. There is an appeal to God’s reputation for forgiveness and kindness; the singer trusts God’s compassionate nature and asks for guidance, protection, and deliverance from enemies and need. The tone blends humble dependence with confident hope in God’s faithful response.","gospelSummary":"Mark 5:21-43 intertwines two intimate encounters that reveal Jesus’ authority over sickness and death and the role of faith. A synagogue official named Jairus begs Jesus to heal his dying daughter; Jesus goes with him amid a pressed crowd. On the way a woman with a long-standing hemorrhage reaches out and touches Jesus’ cloak and is immediately healed. Jesus recognizes that power has gone forth and affirms the woman’s faith, sending her away in peace. Messengers announce the girl’s death, but Jesus urges Jairus to keep trusting. At the house Jesus excludes the crowd, brings only a few close disciples and the child’s parents, and by his command restores the girl to life, instructing the family to give her something to eat.","saintReflection":"St. Blaise (Optional Memorial): St. Blaise (d. 316) was a physician who became bishop of Sebaste and was later martyred for the faith. Tradition connects him with a miracle involving the healing of a child’s throat, which is why Catholics often seek his intercession for throat ailments and celebrate the Blessing of Throats on or near his feast day.","dailyPrayer":"Heavenly Father, you hear the cry of the lowly and reach out in mercy to heal and restore. Grant us the faith of the woman who touched your Son’s cloak and the humility of Jairus who sought help for his child. In moments of fear, help us to trust rather than despair. Lift the burdens of those who suffer illness, loneliness, and grief; bring your consolation and life where death seems to have the last word. Make us instruments of your compassion, attentive to opportunities to bring practical care and prayer. When we are tempted to stand apart, teach us to draw near with courage. Strengthen our hope in the resurrection that Jesus showed when he raised the daughter to life. May our hearts be open to the healing gifts you offer, and may we live, like Christ, in loving service to others. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, forever. Amen.","theologicalSynthesis":"These readings place before us two contrasting but converging dramas: the tragic human violence and grief in David’s household, and the renewing power of Jesus over illness and death. David’s mourning over Absalom shows the cost of sin and broken relationships even for a king, while the psalmist appeals to God’s mercy and steadfast love as the sure refuge of the faithful. In the Gospel Jesus’ power to heal and to raise is mediated through faith: the woman’s touch and Jairus’ plea both exemplify trust that draws forth God’s restorative action. Theologically, the texts insist that divine compassion answers human need, but it often meets us as we take the risk of approaching God. The church reads these passages as an exhortation to persistent prayer, courageous outreach, and confident hope in God’s life-giving presence amid sorrow and death.","exegesis":"Context:\nThe first reading comes from the aftermath of Absalom’s rebellion against his father David. The narrative concentrates on the chaotic end of the revolt: Absalom, once a charismatic challenger, is felled not by a heroic duel but by misfortune and then by a soldier’s brutality. The story highlights the tragic human costs of civil strife, the collapse of filial bonds, and the painful ambiguity of victory for a king who loses a son. The wider context of Samuel’s narrative questions the cost of political ambition and the moral complexity of leadership.\n\nPsalm:\nPsalm 86, placed here, functions as a personal lament and petition. The psalmist’s language of pleading for mercy and attentive listening complements the narrative of personal loss in Samuel. The Psalm’s trust in God’s forgiving and kind character balances human misery with confident appeal: even in crisis the one who prays relies on God’s steady love. Liturgically, the psalm invites a posture of humble dependence that prepares the community to receive divine consolation.\n\nGospel:\nMark’s episode juxtaposes private desperation with public proclamation. Jairus embodies the public figure brought low by parental love; the unnamed woman represents private suffering whose very touch transgresses social boundaries. Mark stages their encounters to show Jesus’ authority as both healer and life-giver. Importantly, Mark frames healing as relational and faith-shaped: the narrative insists that power goes forth in conjunction with faith. Jesus’ withholding of spectacle—sending the woman away quietly, limiting witnesses at the girl’s restoration—shifts focus from public acclaim to personal restoration and the quiet working of God’s reign.\n\nSaints:\nAlthough no specific saint is provided on this date in the material given, the figures in the readings serve as exemplar saints. Jairus and the woman demonstrate dispositions the church venerates: courageous trust, patient endurance, humble initiative, and sacrificial love. Their examples resonate with the broader communion of the faithful who stand with the sick and plead for life. The narrative invites the faithful to see saintliness not only in famous martyrs or ascetics but in everyday acts of trusting approach to Christ on behalf of self and others.\n\nToday:\nFor contemporary readers these passages speak into pastoral care, public leadership, and private suffering. Leaders are reminded that power often entails grief and moral burden; the flock that follows must recognize the human cost of conflict. Pastoral ministry learns from Jesus’ attentive, personal responses—he honors privacy, affirms faith, and restores life. For modern believers the texts encourage approaching God with both boldness and humility: to bring desperate petitions, to risk social exposure for healing, and to trust that God acts even when circumstances pronounce defeat. The psalm’s plea anchors such trust in the character of God, while David’s lament warns that spiritual and moral repair is ongoing.\n\nConclusion:\nTaken together, these readings form a pastoral and theological program: acknowledge grief honestly, cry out for mercy, approach Jesus courageously, and practice compassion actively. The biblical drama refuses easy resolutions; it offers instead a pattern of trust shaped by sorrow, mercy, and the surprising in-breaking of life where death seemed final. The church’s vocation is to embody that pattern, proclaiming God’s steadfast love and acting as a channel of healing in a world marked by brokenness.","tags":["ordinary-time","healing","faith","mercy","grief","resurrection"],"usccbLink":"https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/020326.cfm","cycle":"Year B","weekdayCycle":"Cycle II","feast":"","firstReadingRef":"2 Samuel 18:9-10, 14b, 24-25a, 30–19:3","secondReadingRef":"","psalmRef":"Psalm 86:1-2, 3-4, 5-6","gospelRef":"Mark 5:21-43","lectionaryKey":"2026-02-03:2 Samuel 18:9-10, 14b, 24-25a, 30–19:3||Psalm 86:1-2, 3-4, 5-6|Mark 5:21-43"}]
