    "quote": "Are you envious because I am generous?",
    "quoteCitation": "Mt 20:15",
    "firstReading": "With little ceremony, Judges 9 presents the parable of the trees: leaders are chosen not for virtue but for their willingness to claim power—often a dangerous pursuit. Jotham’s fable warns against ambition divorced from justice, foreshadowing the disasters that result from self-interested leadership.",
    "psalmSummary": "Psalm 21 is a kingly hymn acknowledging God's gifts as the source of all true prosperity. The psalmist blesses the abundant life, hope, and joy that godly leadership brings.",
    "gospelSummary": "Jesus’s parable of the laborers in the vineyard reverses conventional notions of merit. All receive the same reward, regardless of when they began—the kingdom of God is pure gift, not payment for effort. The parable dismantles comparisons and envy, turning disciples toward gratitude for mercy.",
    "saintReflection": "Today, the Church honors Saint Bernard of Clairvaux—abbot, preacher, and doctor whose zeal for authentic Christian living reformed a continent. His leadership was shaped by humility, prayer, and an uncompromising commitment to Christ, not self-promotion.",
    "dailyPrayer": "Lord, give us hearts free of envy, happy for each gift and grace in others. Teach us to work in your vineyard joyfully, knowing every reward is mercy, not entitlement. Make us instruments of peace and unity in all we do.",
    "theologicalSynthesis": "Divine generosity disrupts human measures of worth. The Gospel, the parable, and the saint declare that what matters is not when or where we enter the vineyard, but the openness to grace and the spirit of humility.",
    "exegesis": "Jotham’s parable is a stern satire—trees seeking a king are forced to reckon with the motives of their would-be rulers. Its tone is unmistakably cautionary, inviting reflection on what real leadership means and how ambition can corrode communal life.\\nPsalm 21 brings the focus back to God as the wellspring of every blessing. Good governance and prosperity are gifts, not conquests.\\nThe Gospel’s laborers are a perennial source of controversy: justice seems offended when each is paid equally, but Jesus redirects the lens to mercy. Entitlement becomes a temptation to envy, while the real scandal—and joy—of the kingdom is the freedom of God’s mercy to upend every competition.\\nSaint Bernard’s legacy endures wherever reform and humility are needed. His devotion, learning, and opposition to excesses within the Church call each new generation to discern the difference between ambition and vocation. God’s abundance is enough for all.",
