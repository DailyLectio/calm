    "quote": "Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'",
    "quoteCitation": "(Mt 26:26)",
    "firstReading": "Exodus 16:2-4, 12-15 recounts Israel’s complaints about hunger in the wilderness, countered by God’s free and faithful gift of manna. Even amid collective grumbling, God’s miraculous provision establishes a new way of trusting daily in divine care—a bread from heaven signifying both sustenance and covenant relationship.",
    "psalmSummary": "Psalm 34:2-9 is a hymn of thanksgiving, inviting all to 'taste and see the goodness of the Lord.' The psalmist declares God’s close attention to the poor and brokenhearted, promising deliverance from every distress. Gratitude and awe characterize the righteous, who trust the Lord as both refuge and provider.",
    "gospelSummary": "Matthew 26:26-30 captures the Last Supper, where Jesus dramatically transforms Passover bread and wine into the Eucharist—His real body and blood, given for the life of the world. This institution inaugurates the new covenant, binding the community to Christ and each other through self-sacrificial love.",
    "saintReflection": "Saint Mother Teresa of Calcutta, rooted in Eucharistic prayer, lived Christ’s command by feeding, caring for, and dignifying the world’s most abandoned. Her radical charity expressed the gospel’s call to see Christ in every suffering face, offering concrete love as the truest worship.",
    "dailyPrayer": "Lord Jesus, break the bread of compassion in our hearts, that we may serve those in need with humble love and joy. Shape us by your Eucharist into living signs of unity and hope for a hungry world.",
    "theologicalSynthesis": "The Eucharist as the source and summit of our faith compels a profound response to the world’s needs. God’s consistent provision, from manna to the sacrament, demonstrates an extravagant love that challenges us to resist indifference and exclusion. Mother Teresa’s legacy calls us to embody Eucharistic love through concrete acts of mercy and unity.",
    "exegesis": "The readings unfold a theology of bread—manna, praise, and sacrament—that traverses centuries and shapes Christian identity. In Exodus, the giving of manna occurs in the context of complaint and doubt. Israel’s wandering exposes both human frailty and divine grace; God meets them not with anger, but with sustenance, training the people to rely on him daily ('gather as much as you need for today'). The manna, described elsewhere as 'the bread of angels,' is at once a sign of God’s faithfulness and a foreshadowing of something greater. Early Christians, reflected in John’s Gospel and the Didache, quickly saw in the manna story an anticipation of Jesus’ own promise of living bread.\n\nPsalm 34 transforms this historical memory into praise and assurance. The psalmist, having experienced deliverance, invites the faithful to “taste and see”—an image that bridges spiritual and physical nourishment. In the Psalm, deliverance is personal and communal: God saves the brokenhearted, hears the cry of the poor, and rescues from every trial. The invitation to taste prefigures not only the Eucharist but also the Church’s ongoing experience of God’s tangible goodness in Word, worship, and community.\n\nMatthew’s Gospel places these motifs at their highest fulfillment: at table on the night before his death, Jesus takes up Israel’s memory (Passover) and brings it to its greatest intensity. 'Take and eat; this is my body'—He identifies Himself as the bread from heaven, freely given for all. The Eucharistic words are performative: as the blessing was spoken over manna and over Passover’s unleavened bread, so now the Word-made-flesh speaks a new reality. The covenant, formerly sealed with the blood of lambs, is now sealed by Christ’s own blood. This act creates not simply a ritual but a new community, a people whose very life is to be “broken and shared” for the world.\n\nMother Teresa, whose feast is observed today, stands as a modern witness to the transformative logic of the Eucharist. Her daily adoration of Christ in the Host became concrete among the sick, dying, and abandoned in Calcutta and throughout the world. She understood that the real presence demands a real response: feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, upholding dignity. Her oft-quoted words—'If we can see Jesus in the bread, we will also see Him in the broken bodies that we serve'—embody both the mystical and practical heart of Catholic faith. For contemporary disciples, this day’s readings challenge us to integrate adoration with action, thanksgiving with service, and ritual with justice.\n\nHistorically, the connections flow from the Exodus journey to the cross, from wilderness bread to the Church’s altar and onward into the streets of every city. The Church’s ancient liturgies have always united remembrance with presence, petition with mission. Today’s message remains urgent: as the world faces new hungers—physical, spiritual, communal—the call is to become Eucharist for others, living in such a way that all people may indeed taste and see that the Lord is good.",
