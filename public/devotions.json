[{"date":"2026-01-17","quote":"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.","quoteCitation":"Mark 2:13-17","firstReading":"Samuel is asked to find Saul when the tribe of Benjamin seeks a missing donkey. Saul, a handsome and tall young man from a notable family, goes in search. Samuel, instructed by God, meets Saul and privately anoints him with oil, indicating God’s choice of Saul as leader over Israel. Samuel pronounces signs confirming this divine election, and Saul is sent away with instructions and a prophetic seal of office.","secondReading":"","psalmSummary":"The psalm celebrates the king’s joy and God’s victorious favor: the Lord grants the desires of the king’s heart and crowns him with glory. The psalmist praises God for answered prayer and protection, recounting the king’s strength in victory and the Lord’s enduring steadfastness. It recognizes God’s faithfulness as the foundation of the ruler’s success and the people's rejoicing.","gospelSummary":"In Mark 2:13–17 Jesus calls Levi the tax collector as he passes by, saying simply, “Follow me.” Levi responds by hosting a meal for Jesus, inviting many tax collectors and others labeled as sinners. Observing this, some scribes and Pharisees question why Jesus eats with such people. Jesus answers that he has come not for the righteous but for sinners, using the image of a physician who cares for the sick. The episode highlights Jesus’ openness to the marginalized, the call to discipleship coming to unexpected people, and a formative ministry rooted in mercy rather than ritual purity alone.","saintReflection":"Saint Anthony of Egypt (Memorial): Saint Anthony of Egypt (c. 251–356) is honored as the father of Christian monasticism.[75][78] After hearing the Gospel call to sell all and follow Christ, he gave away his inheritance and retired into the Egyptian desert, where he waged spiritual warfare against temptations and demons.[75] Disciples gathered around him, leading him to outline a way of life that inspired later monastic rules.[75][78] His fame drew even emperors to seek his counsel, and he briefly left solitude to defend the Church against Arianism before returning to the desert.","dailyPrayer":"Lord Jesus, you call the unexpected and embrace the overlooked. Grant me courage to hear your summons and leave behind what holds me back. Give me a heart ready to receive mercy and to extend it, that I may sit with those in need of your healing. Like Levi, may I respond without hesitation; like Anthony, may I pursue prayerful conversion and simplicity. Strengthen me against temptation, guide me in humility, and shape my life for service. Help your Church to remain a refuge for sinners and a beacon of your compassionate love. Amen.","theologicalSynthesis":"These readings gather around a single theological motif: God’s sovereign initiative in calling and transforming persons. In Samuel, divine election of Saul shows God raising leaders by grace beyond human calculation. The psalm frames such leadership as an effect of God’s favor and fidelity, praised in communal worship. Mark’s Gospel brings the theme to Christological focus: Jesus calls sinners like Levi and sits among them, embodying God’s mercy made flesh. Saint Anthony manifests the call’s interior consequence — radical conversion, withdrawal for prayer, and spiritual struggle. Together they teach that vocation involves both a divine summons and a personal response of repentance, mercy, and persistent fidelity. The Church’s ministry must mirror Christ’s mission: to seek, heal, and reform lives through mercy, while leaders serve with humility under God’s authority.","exegesis":"Introduction: The appointed readings for this day present a compact narrative of calling, response, and the consequences of God’s initiative in human affairs. From Samuel’s prophetic anointing to Mark’s portrayal of Jesus’ controversial table fellowship, the texts invite reflection on how God chooses leaders and how those called must live out conversion. Saint Anthony’s life supplies an embodied response to the Gospel’s summons, while the psalm provides the liturgical language by which the community praises God’s saving action.\n\nContext: The first reading (1 Samuel 9:1–4, 17–19; 10:1) sits at a turning point in Israel’s history. Samuel, the last of the judges and the prophet who hears God’s word, is the one who identifies and anoints Saul as Israel’s first king. The narrative stresses both human search and divine appointment: a practical quest for lost animals furnishes the occasion for God’s revelation of a new political order. Saul’s outward qualities — his stature and family standing — are noted, yet his selection is ultimately God’s doing, sealed by prophetic signs and a private anointing with oil. The text underscores the interplay of the ordinary and the sacred: God’s purposes break into everyday life.\n\nPsalm: Psalm 21 (selected verses) frames the king’s success as a gift from Yahweh. The psalmist attributes victory, answered prayer, and exaltation to God’s favor rather than human prowess. The image of crowning and triumph resonates with royal ideology, but the theological point is that God is the source of honor and deliverance. For the community, such a psalm becomes a liturgical reflection on how divine providence directs the fortunes of rulers and people alike; praise and trust are therefore appropriate responses.\n\nGospel: Mark 2:13–17 compresses several theological lines into a simple scene. Jesus’ call of Levi models vocation as both unexpected encounter and immediate response. Levi’s hospitality — bringing others labeled as ‘sinners’ to eat with Jesus — furnishes the setting for a teaching moment about the nature of Jesus’ mission. The Pharisees’ objection focuses on purity and social boundaries; Jesus reframes the issue in terms of mercy, using the metaphor of a physician to justify his table fellowship. Here the kingdom’s arrival subverts the insider/outsider distinctions of the prevailing religious establishment and places compassion at the heart of ministry.\n\nSaints: The life of Saint Anthony of Egypt brings a dramatic, ascetical counterpoint to the communal scenes in the readings. After hearing the Gospel call to sell all and follow, Anthony embraced solitude, spiritual combat, and the disciplined pursuit of holiness. His withdrawal into the desert was not escapism but a radical means of responding to Christ’s summons. Antony’s example shows that vocation can require both detachment from worldly securities and sustained interior struggle. Yet his later role as spiritual father and advisor indicates that solitary fidelity can generate communal fruit, producing disciples and institutions that shape Christian life.\n\nToday: The theological and pastoral questions raised by these readings remain pressing. Who are the ‘sinners’ at whose table we must sit? How do leaders exercise authority as service under God’s providence? In a world marked by social fragmentation and moral complexity, the texts call the Church to a posture of mercy without abandoning moral integrity. The call to conversion is both communal and personal: communities must create spaces where those burdened by sin find healing, while individuals — like Saul, Levi, and Anthony — must respond to God’s initiative with trust, repentance, and perseverance. Pastoral ministry that mirrors Christ’s hospitality will prioritize outreach, repentance, and formation, trusting that God alone crowns human effort with lasting fruit.\n\nConclusion: The readings weave a narrative of divine initiative and human response. God chooses and equips; the proper response is not merely social conformity but transformed life expressed in mercy, prayer, and right leadership. Whether in the desert cell or around a common table, the Christian vocation is to follow the one who comes for sinners, to be healed, and to become instruments of that same healing for others.","tags":["saint-anthony-of-egypt","call","vocation","mercy","repentance","leadership","saint-anthony","tax-collectors","anointing"],"usccbLink":"https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/011726.cfm","cycle":"Year B","weekdayCycle":"Cycle II","feast":"Memorial","firstReadingRef":"1 Samuel 9:1-4, 17-19; 10:1","secondReadingRef":"","psalmRef":"Psalm 21:2-3, 4-5, 6-7","gospelRef":"Mark 2:13-17","lectionaryKey":"2026-01-17:1 Samuel 9:1-4, 17-19; 10:1||Psalm 21:2-3, 4-5, 6-7|Mark 2:13-17"}]
