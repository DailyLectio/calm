    "exegesis": "Historical Context:\nPaul’s focus on fraternal love reflects the social cohesion necessary for survival among early Christians in Thessalonica. The parable of the talents (Greek ταλαντον, talanton) illustrates economic and spiritual stewardship, a pressing issue in the agrarian and mercantile contexts of first-century Palestine. Psalm 98’s call for a new song invites participation in God’s ongoing work of justice and renewal.\n\nTheological Background:\nThe talents represent opportunities—spiritual, material, intellectual—given for the building of God’s kingdom. Patristic expositors like Gregory the Great taught that stewardship is measured by growth and risk, not by maintenance alone. Mary’s fiat is the ultimate model of openness to grace, showing how humility and courage unite for faithful action.\n\nContemporary Application:\nIn today’s world, young people are called to invest their talents generously, resisting the temptation to settle for comfort. Stewardship means engaging creatively with challenges, participating in community life, and embracing new ways to serve. The psalm’s invitation to joyful praise affirms that God’s mercy is active and accessible. For youth, Mary’s trust provides hope that saying yes to God’s call brings true fulfillment.",
