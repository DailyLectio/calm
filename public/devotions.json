  "exegesis": "First Reading:\nDeut 10 follows Israel’s failure with the calf and the gracious renewal of the tablets. The summons—‘what does the LORD ask?’—is not a ladder up to God but a response to mercy already received. This echoes the weekend arc: love must be whole (Dt 6), vigilant trust is commended (Sunday), and now Moses gathers that energy into five verbs—fear (yārē’), walk (hālak), love (’ahav), serve (‘ābad), keep.\n\nFrom cosmic ownership—‘the heaven of heavens’—God turns to elective love: ‘Yet the LORD set His heart on your fathers’ (10:15). Israel’s identity is birthed by grace, not ṣĕdāqâ of their own. The imperative ‘circumcise the foreskin of your heart’ (10:16) calls for inner transformation matching the gift.\n\nThe living God executes justice for the orphan and widow and loves the gēr (10:18). Therefore, ‘love the gēr’ (10:19). Discipleship is imitatio Dei: the people mirror God’s character. In Israel’s memory, the exodus is not nostalgia but a moral engine—‘for you were gērîm in Egypt.’\n\nThe verbs ‘ābad (serve/worship) and hālak (walk) resist compartmentalization: altar and street belong together. Deut 10 will reverberate into Mt 18’s concern for ‘little ones’: the God who commands love for the gēr goes before His people; inner awe bears social fruit.\n\nPractically: ‘fear’ here is covenantal awe, not dread; it quiets grasping and opens the hand. ‘Walk’ implies habit; we schedule love. ‘Love’ is covenant loyalty that acts. As Sunday’s Gospel pressed treasure into heaven, Deut 10 presses treasure into the stranger: where your love lands, there your heart will be.\n\nPsalm:\nPsalm 147:12–20 alternates provision (strong gates, wheat in peace) with revelation (God’s dābār/logos racing across creation and into Israel’s statutes). The same Word that orders weather forms a people; field and law are different registers of one speech.\n\n‘He has not dealt thus with any nation’ can sound like privilege unless read with Deut 10’s ethic. The gift of Torah becomes the task of witness: receiving statutes that sculpt a people who defend the weak. Blessing tends toward mission.\n\n‘He strengthens the bars of your gates’ is security language, yet the psalm resists fortress religion: peace, wheat, and revelation flow outward. In Clare’s monastic imagination, enclosure serves intercession—gates strengthened so the poor can find bread and peace within.\n\nPractically: let God’s Word ‘run swiftly’ into our structures—budgets, calendars, civic life. If the logos orders wind and snow, it can order households toward mercy; statutes become muscle memory for love of the gēr.\n\nGospel:\nFrom Transfiguration’s afterglow to the valley’s need, Jesus again speaks of being paradídotai (‘handed over’), and the disciples are lypēthēsan (‘deeply grieved’). Sunday emphasized fearless stewardship; tomorrow (Mt 18) will pivot to childlike humility and fierce care for ‘little ones.’ Today bridges them: royal sonship expressed as humble accommodation.\n\nQuestioned about the didrachmon (temple half-shekel), Jesus argues from household logic: earthly kings don’t tax their sons; how much more the Father’s huios in His house. The claim is tacit but audacious—filial freedom.\n\nYet—‘lest we cause skandalon.’ Jesus yields rightful exemption to protect the weak and keep the mission clear. This anticipates Mt 18:6 and harmonizes with Paul’s pastoral tact (1 Cor 8–10): Christian liberty is cruciform.\n\nThe fish with a stater (four drachmas) pays for two—Jesus and Peter. This is pedagogy, not spectacle. The King provides for His house as we practice accommodation. It also binds Peter to the Son: grace covers us together, anchoring Petrine leadership in dependence.\n\nOn the cusp of the Jerusalem journey, within a Judaism soon to face the temple’s fall, Jesus models respectful participation without compromise—a template for believers in contested civic and religious spaces: sons free, neighbors loved.\n\nDiscipleship today: where could insisting on our rights impede someone’s path to Jesus? Where might a quiet, costly accommodation serve another’s faith? The Cross-shaped answer is not weakness but wisdom.\n\nSaint:\nBorn to nobility, Clare slipped from Assisi on Palm Sunday to join Francis, receiving a rough tunic and a new forma vitae. For forty-two years at San Damiano she governed a sisterhood whose only wealth was Christ; shortly before death she secured the Privilege of Poverty.\n\nIn letters to Agnes of Prague, Clare urges: ‘Gaze, consider, contemplate, and desire to imitate.’ Psalm 147’s Word that orders creation orders a soul by contemplative attention to the poor and crucified Christ.\n\nPoverty as filial freedom: because she is a daughter, she lays down claims. Her nihil proprium (having nothing of one’s own) turns autonomy into availability—the kenosis that makes room for the neighbor, especially the gēr at the gate.\n\nEcclesial witness: the coin from the fish pays for two; Clare funds witness by two currencies—contemplation and service. Her poverty critiques consumer anxiety, and her obedience models the Gospel’s ‘no-scandal’ principle: yield non-essentials to clear the way for essentials.\n\nFor us: in a rights-assertive culture, Clare’s freedom is luminous. Choose the Cross-shaped yes that protects the little ones, and let worship (‘ābad) spill over as organized mercy. That is how a city’s gates are truly strengthened.",

  "quoteCitation": "Matthew 17:26–27",
  "firstReading": "Moses gathers Israel’s vocation into five movements—fear, walk, love, serve, keep—and calls for a circumcised heart. God’s transcendence meets tender justice for the widow, orphan, and gēr (resident alien). Election is gift; worship must become mercy.",
  "psalmSummary": "God fortifies Jerusalem and sends His word swiftly; the same Word that orders weather gives Israel statutes. Creation and covenant belong together—revelation forms a people for peace and mission.",
  "gospelSummary": "After predicting His passion, Jesus teaches that as Son He is free from the temple tax, yet He pays to avoid scandal. A providential stater covers both Peter and Jesus, modeling freedom gladly limited for others’ good.",
  "dailyPrayer": "Father of mercies, You asked not tribute but a heart made whole—to fear, to walk, to love, to serve, to keep. By Your Spirit, circumcise our hearts; un-stiffen what is stubborn, deepen what is shallow, and align our habits with the path of Your commandments. Let our worship become service, and our doctrine become hospitality for the stranger You love.\n\nLord Jesus, Son over the Father’s house, You are truly free, yet You chose not to scandalize. Teach us the wisdom of voluntary accommodation—to lay down entitlements when love requires it, to take up the costly kindness that clears obstacles for another’s faith. Provide, as You provided the stater, what is needed to fulfill the demands of charity without compromising truth.\n\nHoly Spirit, send Your Word swiftly across our city as in the psalm—strengthen our gates, fill our streets with peace and bread, and engrave Your statutes upon our common life. Make our communities signs of a Kingdom where the orphan is defended, the widow honored, and the gēr welcomed as kin.\n\nSaint Clare, mirror of the poor Christ, intercede for us. School our eyes to gaze on the Crucified until we become what we behold. Free us from the tyranny of “mine,” that we might belong wholly to Christ and be wholly available to our neighbor. May our homes, parishes, and workplaces be monasteries of mercy, where freedom bows to love and love lifts the lowly. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.",
  "saintReflection": "Saint Clare turned noble privilege into the Privilege of Poverty, leading San Damiano by prayer and example. Gazing on the poor and crucified Christ, she learned that true filial freedom becomes availability for others. Her enclosure was intercession: a life that strengthens the city’s gates so the poor find bread and peace. Clare’s poverty critiques anxiety and teaches a joyful obedience that clears away scandal so the Gospel can be seen.",
  "theologicalSynthesis": "Grace precedes obligation: Deut 10 roots ethics in election and presses love toward the gēr. Psalm 147 shows the same Word that orders creation forming a people by statutes. In Matthew 17, the Son freely limits His rights to avoid scandal, modeling cruciform liberty. Together the readings bind worship and justice, freedom and charity, into one covenant life.",
