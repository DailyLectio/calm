    "exegesis": "Historical Context:\nSirach, part of the wisdom tradition, addresses a Jewish audience grappling with changing political and religious circumstances during the early Hellenistic period. Humility—Greek ταπεινοφροσύνη (tapeinophrosynē)—was considered counter-cultural, yet vital for building community. Luke’s Gospel, written for Gentile Christians facing Roman social pressures, places hospitality and service at the heart of Jesus’ radical mission.\n\nTheological Background:\nPsalm 68’s theme of God’s preference for the vulnerable echoes Israel’s covenant commitment to justice. Patristic commentators such as Chrysostom and Basil viewed humility as the core of Christian discipleship and the key antidote to pride and division. Thérèse of Lisieux’s spirituality, highlighted in Catholic catechesis, illustrates that even small acts of love hold immense spiritual value.\n\nContemporary Application:\nFor teens and young adults, humility means setting aside competition to foster authentic connection. Welcoming others—especially the marginalized—models true greatness in friendship, church, and school. Thérèse’s example reassures that faithfulness and joy in simple things matter to God and transform the world.",
