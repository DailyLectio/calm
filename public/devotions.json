    "exegesis": "August 8, 2025, calls the faithful to encounter the transforming hope found in Christ’s victory over death. The narrative of 2 Maccabees 7 takes place during a time of cultural oppression under Seleucid rule, when Jewish identity and worship faced severe threat. The steadfastness of seven brothers and their mother—suffering torture and death for their faith—foreshadows Christian martyrdom and signals a developed theology of resurrection already taking root in Jewish tradition. Psalm 27, a classic psalm of trust, reinforces this posture by presenting God as steadfast protector and source of courage in trial. The Gospel of John, recounting the raising of Lazarus, occupies a pivotal place in Jesus’ public ministry. Martha’s confession mirrors Peter’s elsewhere in the Gospels, and Jesus’ declaration, 'I am the resurrection and the life,' advances belief in him as both Messiah and source of eternal life. This episode anticipates Jesus' own death and resurrection, proclaiming the transformation of despair into hope. Saint Dominic, celebrated today, responded to spiritual and doctrinal confusion in 13th-century Europe by founding an order dedicated to preaching, learning, and poverty. His legacy reflects the day’s readings: in the face of error and suffering, he steadfastly pointed to the truth of the Gospel and the hope of resurrection. The convergence of martyr faith, psalmic trust, and resurrection witness invites the Church and all believers to live boldly as 'resurrection people.' Despite suffering, loss, or societal challenge, the assurance of Christ as the resurrection and the life anchors Christian hope and energizes mission.",
