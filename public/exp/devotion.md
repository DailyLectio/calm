While this day in 2025 is marked as Ordinary Time without a specific saint's memorial, the themes resonate with the witness of many saints who embraced the hope of resurrection amid suffering.

# Detailed Scriptural Exegesis
The first reading from Deuteronomy 4:32-40 is part of Moses' farewell discourse to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land. This passage serves as a theological reflection on the identity of Israel as God's chosen people. Moses challenges the people to consider the uniqueness of their history: no other nation has experienced the direct intervention of God in the way Israel has. The rhetorical questions in verses 32-33 emphasize the unparalleled nature of God's revelation and mighty deeds, such as the giving of the law at Horeb (Mount Sinai). This historical memory is not merely nostalgic but serves as a foundation for covenantal fidelity.

Moses exhorts the people to keep God's commandments as a response to His love and to ensure their well-being in the land they are about to possess. The passage underscores the concept of covenant as a reciprocal relationship: God's faithfulness demands human obedience. The concluding verses (39-40) affirm God's uniqueness as the one true God who alone can save, reinforcing monotheistic faith and the call to exclusive worship.

Psalm 77 complements this by expressing the psalmist's struggle with distress and the subsequent turning to God's past deeds for reassurance. The psalmist recalls God's wonders, such as the parting of the Red Sea, as evidence of His power and mercy. The structure of the psalm moves from lament to confident trust, illustrating a spiritual journey from doubt to hope. This mirrors the experience of the Israelites and invites the faithful to meditate on God's saving history as a source of strength.

The Gospel of John 11:17-27 is situated within the larger narrative of the raising of Lazarus, a pivotal sign revealing Jesus' divine authority over life and death. Jesus arrives after Lazarus has died and engages Martha in a profound theological dialogue. His statement, "I am the resurrection and the life," is a clear self-revelation of His identity and mission. This declaration echoes Old Testament themes of God as the giver of life and the hope of resurrection.

Martha's response is a confession of faith that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, who has come into the world. This confession is significant because it acknowledges Jesus' divine nature and the hope He offers. The dialogue also prepares the reader for the miracle of Lazarus' resurrection, which will further confirm Jesus' power and foreshadow His own resurrection.

Theologically, this passage invites believers to a faith that transcends physical death, promising eternal life to those who believe. It challenges the community to see Jesus not only as a teacher or prophet but as the source of life itself.

Together, these readings form a coherent message about God's saving power, the call to faithful obedience, and the hope of resurrection. They encourage believers to remember God's past faithfulness, trust in His promises, and live in the hope of eternal life through Christ.
