Though the exact historical date of Christ's birth is uncertain, December 25 has been celebrated since at least the fourth century as the feast of Christmas in the Western Church. The celebration of Christmas is distinguished by a threefold celebration of the Mass: the Vigil Mass on Christmas Eve, the Mass during the Night, the Mass at Dawn, and the Mass during the Day. Throughout Advent, the Church longed for Christ's coming; on Christmas, she celebrates His birth with unrestrained joy. The Incarnation reveals God's infinite love and humility, as the eternal Word assumed human nature to reconcile humanity with the divine and to offer the gift of eternal life through participation in Christ's redemptive sacrifice.",

One of seven deacons chosen by the Apostles to assist in the distribution of charitable aid to widows and the poor, Stephen was described in Acts as 'filled with faith and with the Holy Spirit' and 'full of grace and strength,' radiating divine grace and apostolic zeal. He performed great wonders and signs among the people, proclaiming Christ with power and wisdom. When accused before the Sanhedrin, his accusers 'were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit that spoke.' Infuriated by his bold witness to Christ, the council dragged Stephen outside Jerusalem and stoned him to death. Before his execution, Stephen had a vision of heaven: 'Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.' As stones struck him down, he prayed forgiveness for his murderers: 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them,' echoing his Master's words from the Cross. A young man named Saul witnessed Stephen's execution and approved of it; this same Saul would later convert and become Saint Paul the Apostle.",

At the foot of the Cross, the dying Jesus entrusted His mother Mary to John's care. John was present at the Resurrection's discovery and the miraculous catch of fish afterward. In his extreme old age, John continued visiting the churches of Asia Minor, repeating only: 'My dear children, love one another.' John is the author of the Fourth Gospel, three Epistles of John, and the Book of Revelation. His Gospel emphasizes the divinity of Christ and the fraternal love to which God calls His children. According to tradition, under Emperor Domitian, John was plunged into a caldron of boiling oil but miraculously emerged unharmed, after which he was exiled to the island of Patmos, where he received the mystical visions recorded in the Apocalypse. He is the only Apostle who died of natural causes rather than martyrdom, living to approximately 101 years of age. John is the patron saint of authors, loyalty, and friendship.",

Herod, consumed with fear and jealousy over the birth of a promised king, commanded the slaughter of all male children in Bethlehem and its vicinity under the age of two. Though the exact number of children killed is uncertain (possibly between twenty and a few thousand), the Church honors them as the first martyrs for Christ. These innocent children, guilty of no crime except being potential threats to Herod's throne, died in circumstances intimately connected with Christ's birth. Though they could not consciously confess the faith, they are recognized as holy because they shed their blood in connection with Christ. Saint Augustine reflected: 'Herod accordingly kills many little children, in his determination to bring about the death of just one.' Their cruel and tragic deaths have been transformed by God into eternal glory. The Church celebrates them with the liturgical color red, the color of martyrdom, and invokes their intercession on behalf of innocents in danger and children at risk. Their feast is a powerful reminder of God's providence, which transforms suffering into redemptive grace.",

Elevated to the diaconate and eventually to the priesthood, he was chosen as Pope at an advanced age. During his pontificate, Emperor Constantine gave the Church unprecedented freedom and support. Under Sylvester's leadership and with Constantine's patronage, magnificent churches were built, including the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, the Basilica of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, and Old Saint Peter's Basilica. Though Sylvester did not personally attend the First Council of Nicaea in 325, he sent legates and approved the Council's decisions defending Orthodox faith against Arianism. Sylvester represented Christians in theological disputations and demonstrated the faith with courage and learning. He organized Church discipline for this new era of peace, transformed the Church from a persecuted community into an organized society with ecclesiastical property and institutional structures. Saint Sylvester died peacefully in old age and was buried in the Catacomb of Priscilla. His feast celebrates the victory of Christ and the triumph of His Church.",
